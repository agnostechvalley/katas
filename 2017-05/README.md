# Trading Card Game

Found at: http://codingdojo.org/kata/TradingCardGame/

## About this Kata

In this Kata you will be implementing a rudimentary two-player trading card game. The rules are loosely based on [Blizzard's Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/) which itself is an already much
simpler and straight-forward game compared to other TCGs like [Magic: The Gathering](http://www.wizards.com/magic/).

__Difficulty:__ Medium/Hard

__Good for teaching:__ Test Doubles, Mocking, TDD, Refactoring, Clean Code

## Problem Description

### Preparation

-   Each player starts the game with 30 Health and 0 Mana slots
-   Each player starts with a deck of 20 Damage cards with the following
    Mana costs: 0,0,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,8
-   From the deck each player receives 3 random cards has his initial
    hand

### Gameplay

-   The active player receives 1 Mana slot up to a maximum of 10 total
    slots
-   The active player's empty Mana slots are refilled
-   The active player draws a random card from his deck
-   The active player can play as many cards as he can afford. Any
    played card empties Mana slots and deals immediate damage to the
    opponent player equal to its Mana cost.
-   If the opponent player's Health drops to or below zero the active
    player wins the game
-   If the active player can't (by either having no cards left in his
    hand or lacking sufficient Mana to pay for any hand card) or simply
    doesn't want to play another card, the opponent player becomes
    active

### Special Rules

-   Bleeding Out: If a player's card deck is empty before the game is
    over he receives 1 damage instead of drawing a card when it's
    his turn.
-   Overload: If a player draws a card that lets his hand size
    become &gt;5 that card is discarded instead of being put into
    his hand.
-   Dud Card: The 0 Mana cards can be played for free but don't do any
    damage either. They are just annoyingly taking up space in
    your hand.

## Clues

When approached iteratively with TDD you can take different starting
points, like the player state or the game loop. It is your own choice
whether you implement the game for human or computer players - or both.
Game visualization can be anything between System.out and a GUI. You can
also increase the difficulty by adding more rules, like Healing cards,
Damage independent from Mana cost or introducing individual Deck
building. You will find some examples of Advanced Variations from the
Kata's author at [https://github.com/bkimminich/kata-tcg](https://github.com/bkimminich/kata-tcg). Even without
extra rules the toughest part of this Kata might be coming up with
actually smart CPU player decision-making algorithms.
